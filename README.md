## About this Repo

Most modern solutions to provision resources on cloud and on-premise use automation systems like Terraform, Ansible and ... to bring Infrastructure as Code. Not only deployment is much faster but also configuration is consistent for all resources and it's a kind of perfect documentation for your network. on another hand, troubleshooting is much easier since the overall deployment can be seen as a code.

In this repo, I tend to start preparing terraform and ansible codes to manage resources on Cloud and On-premise.
the codes will be updated from time to time as I test and deploy them and will be more completed.
